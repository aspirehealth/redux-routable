# Redux Routable

A Redux middleware (and companion React components) to handle your application's
routing needs.

## Packages

[`redux-routable`](./packages/redux-routable) - A simple Redux middleware for
routing. Define the routes of your application, dispatch actions to navigate,
and actions will be dispatched whenever the route changes.

[`redux-routable-react`](./packages/redux-routable-react) - React components
that integrate with Redux Routable. Render content based on the current route,
and declaratively link to different routes.
